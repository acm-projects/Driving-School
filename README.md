# Driving School
*Driving School* is a 3D first-person driving game intended to help student drivers familiarize themselves with the rules of the road and specific areas they might be driving. Users can drive through automatically generated 3D areas based on real-world locations.

In addition to the real-world-location-based environment, *Driving School* also could include certain mechanics that teach users driving rules such as speed limit monitoring and stop sign checking. Users who fail to respect these rules could face in-game penalties.

## Technologies
#### Engines
Possible game engines that could be used for this project are:
* [Unity](https://unity.com/)
* [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/)
* [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

#### APIs
The [Open Street Map API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API) is certainly the best option for a project like this. The OSM API provides tons of data including street and building names, building coordinates to allow for creating dynamic 3D models that are shaped like buildings in the real world, and traffic features.

## Development Information
#### MVP
Every project needs a **m**inimum **v**iable **p**roduct (MVP). The MVP is simply the smallest possible version of a product that is enough to satisfy the most basic requirements. Before beginning development on any project, including *Driving School*, coming up with a list of features to include in the MVP is crucial. The scope of the MVP should be as narrow as possible and should not include features that are not integral to the footprint of the project.

#### Stretch Goals
Stretch goals are features that are added to a project once the MVP phase has been completed. Stretch goals are there to add extra features to a product that don't necessarily have to contribute directly to the product's general footprint.
